# CS136 - Stats Pattern Recognition Projects

[Coding Project 01](cp1-unigram-probabilities): unigram model, addressing two key questions:
- Given training data, how should we estimate the probability of each word? How might estimates change if we have very little (or abundant) data?
- How can we select hyperparameter values to improve our predictions on heldout data, using only the training set?
